# MonoNN
- This is an experimental project to study the modification to multi-layer perception with linear to monomial based neurons.
- The monomial is of the form f(x) = c*(x^n) + b
  - x: input to monimial
  - c: coefficient of x^n
  - b: constant
- This modification adda non-linearity to the system and does not need direct involvement of activation functions to add non-linearity but to use them to restrict the excessive rise and  fall in values.
